# 0x00. Unity - User Interface

What you'll find? This part of my Learning process is about:
- How to navigate the Unity interface
- What is the Scene view
- What is the Game view
- What is the Hierarchy window
- What is the Project window
- What is the Inspector window
- What is the Console window
- What is the Toolbar
- What are the Play Buttons
- What are the Transform tools
- What are the Collab, Services, Account buttons
- What are the Layers and Layouts dropdowns
- What are Gizmos

Here are the task I solve to answer those question and more. The solution to every task is on the file with the same name than the task.

My challenge for you is to try to solve all of this task and after see the way I did it.

All hotkey questions should be answered in all capital letters with `+` separating keystrokes. Use `CTRL/CMD` in your answer if the hotkey includes it. Examples: `CTRL/CMD + S`, `CTRL/CMD + SHIFT + C`, `F` Example:
```
